    static:
    In HTML, by default all the elements position is static, if no position is specified then its considerd as static
    If the element position is static then we can not apply 4 css properties(left, right, top, bottom)
    Element behavior will not change

<!--
    absolute:
    we can apply 4 css properties(left, right, top, bottom).

    Elements behaviour chang from Block level to inline element.
