<!--
    Writing the block-1 after block-2 makes the updating phase to take precedence 
    over mounting phase then how can we say mounting phase will gets executed first and how to prove that?

    >>Because the useEffect the hook we use in all three phases. To make the hook to execute only after the state varibale changes
    (avoid getting executing when its loaded for the first time)we need to include a condition to make it work.

    Also I understand that keep a condition in block-2 will make it work only when the state varible is updated 
    that is specified as a dependant in useEffect but we can do that in block-1 too to simulate the the behavior. 
    Then how can we say the block-2 works only in when there is an update in state variable?

    >> If we observe carefully there is no change from block-1 to block-2 except the dependent change we wanted to track,
    hence its very clear, we need to decide on which block you wnated to execute in updating phase so that we can include the 
    necessary changes like condition check and including dependents.

    THe block-2 is getting executed for the first time even though there is no change in the state varible 
    that is added to useEffect hook as a dependant? 
    >> Yes as it is, that when we make it work by adding a condition in there.
