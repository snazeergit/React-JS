    absolute:
    we can apply 4 css properties(left, right, top, bottom).
    element's space will be removed from the DOM,hence the next element in the row will overlap with absolute elements 
        unless we apply any of the 4 css properties
    Elements behaviour chang from Block level to inline element.
    It takes its parent element(parent must be holding a non-static position else it will take next level parent 
        that has non-static position) as a ref when its applied with any of these 4 css properties(left, right, top, bottom).
