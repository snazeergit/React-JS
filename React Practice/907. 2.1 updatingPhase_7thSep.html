<!--
    When we click on the button the handler method mapped with the button will get executed and
    it will intern invoke the setName() to update the state varible name.
    When state varible updated, render() will be called or return content will be loaded again in DOM
    since we are using useEffect hook to detect the changes in the state variable, block-2 it will also 
    get invoked by React after the changes rendered to the DOM or changes loaded thats when the block-2 
    stmts or updating phase will get executed.
    
    Note: update phase executed only after the change in the state varibles loaded in the DOM.
-->

<!--
    Writing the block-1 after block-2 without state varible change condition makes the updating phase to take precedence 
    over mounting phase then how can we say mounting phase will gets executed first and how to prove that?

    >>Since the useEffect hook used in all three phases of React Life-cycle, to make the hook to execute only 
    after the state varibale changes(avoid getting executing when its loaded for the first time)we must 
    include a condition to check the state varible changes to make it work in updating phase.

    Also I understand that keeping a condition in block-2 will make it work only when the state varible is updated 
    that is specified as a dependant in useEffect but we can do that in block-1 too to simulate the the behavior. 
    Then how can we say the block-2 works only in when there is an update in state variable?

    >> If we observe carefully there is no change from block-1 to block-2 except the dependent change we wanted 
    to track, hence its very clear, we need to decide on which block you wnated to execute in updating phase 
    so that we can include the necessary changes like condition check and including dependents.

    THe block-2 is getting executed for the first time even though there is no change in the state varible 
    that is added to useEffect hook as a dependant? 
    >> Yes, thats when we put a condition to check state variable change.

    useEffect(()=>{
        //stmts written here will executed in the first time.
        if(StateVariableName!='StateVariableInitialVal'){
            //stmts to execute in UPDATING PHASE
        }
    },[StateVariable])
